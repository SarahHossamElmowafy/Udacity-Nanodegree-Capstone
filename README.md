# Cats-Vs-Dogs-Image-Classification

The problem Statements

Given a set of labeled images of  cats and dogs, a  machine learning model  is to be learnt and later it is to be used to classify a set of new images as cats or dogs. 

A few sample labeled images from the training dataset are shown below.

Steps of this program:

i.  Get the data into python.
ii. Prepare the data for the algorithm.
iii.Define the Model.
iv. Train the model and get the results.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:
- Numpy
- Scipy
- scikit-learn
- Tensorflow
- matplotlib
- keras
- cv2
- h5py
- os 
- itertools

we will use VGG16 fine tuning 
keras.applications.vgg16.VGG16()

we will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).
